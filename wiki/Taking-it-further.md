# Taking it Further

Want to extend the Training app? Here are some ideas:

## Extend the user experience

Customize Training app to give custom user experience by updating or
adding new component in `Creation/Response/Results` View. All components
are under src/components. The root component of Creation, Response and
Detail View is `src/CreateView.js`, `src/UpdateView.js`
and `src/DetailView.js` respectively.

## Personalize the app

* Personalize the app by updating the app icon `assets/images/appIcon.png` and `assets/images/outline.png`
* Personalize the app by changing the app strings under assets/strings.
* Personalize the app by changing the app theme. The app uses HTML/CSS
    for UI and theming can be customized by updating the same.
